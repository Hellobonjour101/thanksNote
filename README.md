# thanksNote

## Clone Project (Momentun Chrome)
### Making "Thanks Note" or "TodoList" in your own browser. 
When you type your name and make a list on your brower, localStorage will remember all of them and show you whenever you refresh your browser.

I use space images form Hubble telescope in NASA. 
This is because I want user to feel that their all wishes and appreciations will be sent to the space just by writing on the brower by theirselves. 

<strong>What I've learn from this clone project is..</strong>
> new Image
> new Date
> JSON.stringify
> JSON.parse
> localStorage.setItem/ getItem
